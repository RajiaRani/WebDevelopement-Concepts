                <p>
                    If you want the very best of watchmaking, chances are you’re also going to want the most expensive. These
                    are the top ten most expensive luxury watch brands in the world!
                </p>

            <div class="body-container">
                <h2>A.Lange & Söhne</h2>
                <p>
                    You might not expect the first brand in this list to come from Germany instead of Switzerland, but
                    <a href="https://www.watchfinder.com/A.%20Lange%20and%20Sohne/watches"> A.Lange & Söhne</a>
                    has been making watches in the little watchmaking town of Glashütte since 1845.
                    The area, now famed for its high-quality watch brands, was established by A. Lange & Söhne founder
                    Ferdinand Adolph Lange with help from a government grant to revitalise the dwindling mining town.

                </p>
                <p><img src="watchImg/ALS.webp" alt="A.Lange & Söhne"></p>
                <p>This watchmaker is famed for its precision and attention to detail, establishing the famous German
                    three-quarter plate look. Not only is that a staple German watchmaking trend, it also demonstrated
                    that
                    A. Lange & Söhne had the capability to place precise holes in one large piece of metal, rather than
                    relying on the adjustability of several smaller pieces to make everything fit.

                    The German watchmaker is also known for its incredible—and incredibly inventive—complications, with
                    the
                    $200,000 Triple Split chronograph allowing not just a secondary hand to pause for the seconds, but
                    the
                    minutes and even hours too.

                </p>
            </div>


            <div>
                <h2>Audemars Piguet</h2>
                <p>Primarily known for the Royal Oak, <a href="https://www.watchfinder.com/Blancpain/watches"> Audemars
                        Piguet </a> is most famous for drawing a line in the sand in 1972
                    to turn the entire industry from a supplier of instruments to a creator of luxury. Quartz
                    watches—which
                    were much cheaper and much more accurate—threatened to destroy Switzerland’s entire mechanical
                    watchmaking landscape.

                </p>
                <p><img src="watchImg/AudemarsPiguet.webp" alt="Audemars Piguet"></p>
                <p>It was with some quick thinking—mostly from designer Gerald Genta, who submitted the sketches for the
                    Royal Oak the night before the big unveiling—that Audemars Piguet reinvented the idea of a
                    mechanical
                    watch being a highly desirable luxury item, pricing the simple steel Royal Oak higher than its gold
                    complications. Other masters Patek Philippe and Vacheron Constantin soon took Audemars Piguet’s lead
                    and
                    created their own versions too.

                    But Audemars Piguet wasn’t established on the Royal Oak. Founded way back in 1875, the watchmaker
                    earned
                    its crust in high complication movements for other watchmakers. The quality was so good, it wasn’t
                    long
                    before they started making watches of their own. Nevertheless, it was still a Royal Oak that
                    achieved a
                    $2m price at auction.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h2>Blancpain</h2>
                <p>When you think of the classic dive watch, the first thought is of the Rolex Submariner, but it was in
                    fact <a href="https://www.watchfinder.com/Blancpain/watches"> Blancpain </a> that established the
                    now-famous layout. With a black dial with bold, contrasting markers
                    coated in luminous paint, plus a rotating timing bezel, it was Blancpain’s Fifty Fathoms that
                    sparked a
                    new era.

                </p>
                <p> <img src="watchImg/Blancpain.webp" alt="Blancpain"></p>
                <p>That was in 1953, but Blancpain had already been operating continuously since 1735. It is the oldest
                    watchmaker still in business today, and the excellence of its watchmaking, both in classic
                    complication
                    and sturdy dive watches, has kept it in business. A gem-set tourbillon can cost you upwards of $1m.

                </p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h2>Breguet</h2>
                <p>Many consider <a href="https://www.watchfinder.com/Blancpain/watches">Abraham-Louis Breguet</a> to be
                    the father of modern watchmaking, bridging the gap between the
                    classic English pocket watch makers and the more recent Swiss wristwatch makers. He learnt from the
                    best, worked with the best and became the best, when in 1775, he founded his namesake brand.

                </p>
                <p><img src="watchImg/Breguet.webp" alt="Breguet"></p>
                <p>Some of the things that can be attributed to Breguet include the first automatic movement that wound
                    itself, the tourbillon complication which adds several layers of complexity to cancel out the
                    effects of
                    gravity, the balance spring overcoil to produce a more concentric swing, and more recently, the
                    silicon
                    escapement.
                    <br />

                    Compared to Audemars Piguet and Patek Philippe, Breguet flies under the radar, but is considered by
                    those in the know to be superior. The price is indicative of that, with Breguet’s most expensive
                    watch,
                    a recreation of a complicated pocket watch originally created for Marie Antoinette, fetching $10m.

            <div>
                <h2>Grand Seiko</h2>
                <p>As another watchmaker that hails from outside of Switzerland, you wouldn’t expect a brand with the
                    name
                    “Seiko” in it to be in a most expensive list. Nevertheless, the “Grand” offshoot of the Japanese
                    brand
                    is one that fetches some very pretty pennies indeed.

                </p>
                <p> <img src="watchImg/Grand-Seiko.webp" alt="Grand Seiko"></p>
                <p><a href="https://www.watchfinder.com/Blancpain/watches"> Grand Seiko</a> was originally established
                    in 1960 as an experiment by parent brand Seiko—itself founded in
                    1881—to see if it could beat the Swiss at its own game. Literally—the Swiss hosted annual
                    competitions
                    to see who could make the most accurate watch.

                </p>
                <p>In order to challenge the Swiss, Seiko set up a little internal competition of its own. It built two
                    factories, one King Seiko, the other Grand Seiko, to compete with each other to build the best
                    watch.
                    Year after year the performance improved until eventually, a Grand Seiko mechanical watch beat the
                    Swiss. The Swiss closed the competition after that. The result? The most expensive Grand Seiko you
                    can
                    buy today is a very grand $200,000.

            <div>
                <h2>Jaeger-LeCoultre</h2>
                <p>If you’ve ever wondered why watchmakers such as Patek Philippe, Audemars Piguet and Vacheron
                    Constantin
                    perform so well, the answer somewhere along the line usually goes something like, “Jaeger-LeCoultre
                    helped them.”

                </p>
                <p><img src="watchImg/JLC-Reverso.webp" alt="Jaeger-LeCoultre"></p>
                <p> <a href="https://www.watchfinder.com/Grand%20Seiko/watches"> Jaeger-LeCoultre </a>wrote the book on
                    high-precision watchmaking, developed the processes to even measure at
                    high accuracy. Literally: founder Antoine LeCoultre invented the device that allowed measurement of
                    a
                    thousandth of a millimetre for the first time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A background in metal science allowed Antoine to completely reinvent how watches could be made,
                    paving
                    the way in 1833 for the likes of Patek Philippe etcetera to follow. In fact, Jaeger-LeCoultre often
                    worked with or just outright made the movements for the very best watchmakers in the world, earning
                    it
                    the title, “The watchmakers’ watchmaker.” The most expensive Jaeger-LeCoultre, the incredible
                    Reverso
                    Quadtriptyque, sells for a cool $1.35m.

            <div>
                <h2>Patek Philippe</h2>
                <p>Perhaps the best-known classical watchmaker in the world today, <a
                        href="https://www.watchfinder.com/Grand%20Seiko/watches"> Patek Philippe</a>has earned its
                    reputation
                    by continually advancing watchmaking. Since its founding in 1839, Patek Philippe hasn’t just given
                    us
                    game-changing inventions like the winding and setting crown and split-seconds chronograph
                    wristwatch, it
                    even invented the first electric clock!

                </p>
                <p><img src="watchImg/PatekPhilippe.webp" alt="Patek Philippe"></p>
                <p>Famous historic customers include Queen Victoria, Albert Einstein, Marie Curie, John F. Kennedy,
                    Nelson
                    Mandela, Pablo Picasso and the Pope, all drawn to the reserved intricacy of a Patek Philippe watch.
                    In
                    fact, the way the wristwatch looks today is really thanks to the 1930s Patek Philippe Calatrava,
                    created
                    to save the business when customers were no longer purchasing pocket watches.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Patek Philippe’s reputation is predominantly earnt through its ability to produce high complication
                    watches, with many notable achievements throughout history for the most complex ever produced.
                    Today,
                    its most complicated wristwatch, the Grandmaster Chime, boasts twenty complications and a price tag
                    of
                    $2.6m—although one was recently auctioned for $31m.

                </p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h2>Richard Mille</h2>
                <p>From traditional watchmaking to contemporary, but no less expensive, comes <a
                        href="https://www.watchfinder.com/Grand%20Seiko/watches"> Richard Mille</a>. One of the
                    younger big brands in watchmaking, founded in just 1999, it was created to throw off the stale
                    convention of the industry and try something new. Cases are big and bold, the movements incredibly
                    complex—even when they’re functionally simple—and the prices sky-high.


                </p>
                <p> <img src="watchImg/RichardMile.webp" alt="Richard Mille"></p>
                <p>And these aren’t just show pieces: they’ve been designed to be put through their paces by sporting
                    greats
                    such as Fernando Alonso, Rafael Nadal and Bubba Watson, athletes enduring extreme forces that would
                    break any ordinary watch.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But really, it’s the styling that draws attention to Richard Mille, looking unmistakably unique—even
                    from a distance. As such, a Richard Mille watch will regularly fetch over $1m, with some stretching
                    to
                    even $3.4m.

                </p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h2>Rolex</h2>
                <p>As the most famous watch brand in the entire world, it comes as no surprise to learn that Rolex is
                    also
                    one of the most expensive. Funnily enough, many of its watches are actually some of the cheapest in
                    this
                    list, and by a long, long way—if you can get them. Sky high demand means that there’s no end of
                    customers seeking to get on the waiting list, and that’s made used<a
                        href="https://www.watchfinder.com/Grand%20Seiko/watches"> Rolex </a> watches very expensive
                    indeed.

                </p>
                <p><img src="watchImg/Rolex-Daytona.webp" alt="Rolex"></p>
                <p>For example, the most expensive Rolex sold at retail today is the Daytona Rainbow, a gem-set piece
                    that
                    fetches around $100,000 new. That lucky customer can immediately sell it on for at least $500,000,
                    and
                    could potentially hold out for a $1m if they were feeling lucky.

                </p>
                <p>
                    But the most expensive Rolex ever sold cost significantly more. Another Daytona, this time famed
                    Hollywood actor and racing driver Paul Newman’s own, sold at auction for a whopping $18m.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h2>Vacheron Constantin</h2>
                <p>Last, but very much not least, is the third in the trio of the top three watchmakers alongside Patek
                    Philippe and Audemars Piguet, <a href="https://www.watchfinder.com/Grand%20Seiko/watches"> Vacheron
                        Constantin</a>. Whilst it often sits in the shadow of its famous
                    siblings, it is indeed the one that could well be considered the best. Not only was it founded
                    earlier
                    in 1755, it also, to this day, boasts the record for the most complicated watch ever made.


                </p>
                <p><img src="watchImg/Vacheron-Constantin.webp" alt="Vacheron Constantin"></p>
                <p>Built for the brand’s 260th anniversary, the 57260 pocket watch, a huge thing the size of a saucer
                    and as
                    thick as a brick, packs an incredible 57 different complications—that’s almost three times the Patek
                    Philippe Grandmaster Chime’s roster.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But Vacheron Constantin isn’t a one-trick pony. The brand routinely produced the world’s thinnest
                    watches, as well as some of the most complex and artistically impressive. If you want to buy the
                    57260,
                    well, you can’t. There’s only one, it’s worth around $10m, and it’s already spoken for.
