    <h2>Object Prototypes</h2>
    <p>Prototypes are the mechanism by which JavaSrcipt objects inherit features from one another.</p>
    <p>It is like a single <b>template object</b> that all objects inherit methods and properties deom without having their own copy.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>arr._proto_(reference)</li>
        <li>Array.prototype(actual object)</li>
        <li>String.prototype</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Note</h3>
    <p>Every object in JavaSrcipt has a built-in property, which is called its <b>prototype</b>.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The prototype is itself an object, so the prototype will have its own property, making what's called a prototype chain.</li>
        <li>The chain ends when we reach a prototype that has null for its own prototype.</li>
    </ul>
